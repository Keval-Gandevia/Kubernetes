This project features two microservices on GKE using a shared Persistent Volume for file storage and processing. The first microservice handles file storage and coordinates with the second for product calculations. Deployment is automated via a CI/CD pipeline using GCP services like Cloud Build, Artifact Registry, and GKE.
